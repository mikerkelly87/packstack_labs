# Openstack Labs

**All 3 of these labs will accomplish the same goals but will use a different method**
```
Note: All 3 of these labs will use resources created in the Horizon lab,
so the Horizon lab will need to be completed first.
```

**LAB 1: Horizon**  
This lab will use the Openstack web based dashboard called Horizon  
[LAB 1 -->](Labs/horizon.md)

**LAB 2: CLI**  
This lab will use the Openstack CLI  
[LAB 2 -->](Labs/cli.md)

**LAB 3: Terraform**  
This lab will use the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) Infrastructure As Code (IaC) tool.
Terraform is used by many organizations bc it is compatible with multiple clouds (Openstack, AWS, Azure, etc).  
[LAB 3 -->](Labs/terraform.md)
